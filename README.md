# DataDriven-Local-Outlier-Detection-on-Hadoop

Detected outliers using local outlier factor (LOF) in distributed system on Hadoop 
and optimized by data-driven LOF (DDLOF) with 6 consecutive map reduces, 
which divided the whole dataset into grids 
and applied special algorithm for cross checking supporting area among grids in order to speed up the whole execution.
